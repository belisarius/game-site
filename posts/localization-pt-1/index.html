	<h1>Localization Questions, pt. 1</h1>
	<div class="post-content"><p>Yesterday on <a href="http://twitter.com/benspants">twitter</a> I invited people to submit questions to my <a href="http://ask.fm/benspants">ask.fm</a>, and got a couple of interesting localization ones. I thought they might be interesting enough to re-post here. Some of them are from yesterday, some are...somewhat older.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I always found the Ace Attorney localizations silly, where they took an obviously Japanese setting, called it Los Angeles, and gave everyone English names. However, the punny names, etc, wouldn&#39;t work at all for a Western audience if they were kept Japanese. How would you handle a project like that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/loc_p_1/santa.png" class="pull-left img-rounded" title="Santa" alt="Santa from Aksys Games and Chunsoft's 'Zero Escape: Nine Hourse, Nine Persons, Nine Doors'">
Depends on the source material. In 999, for instance, we changed all the names (well, except for Santa and, obviously, Seven) because each of their names was tied to their number in some way, and there would be no way to explain the Japanese connections in the English translation without it being extremely awkward. Santa has to explain &quot;san&quot; (there was no way around that) and it&#39;s weird. In this case, the clear answer was to change the names, and elements of the setting.</p>
<p>I debating doing the same thing with Sweet Fuse (and actually came up with names for a few of them: Shidou was Arthur Knight, Wakasa was Justin Young, Meoshi was Preston Keyes, Shirabe was Walker Hunt) since in Japanese their names all have a connection to who they are, but ultimately we decided not to do that. Their name meanings were basically just &quot;fun&quot;—not integral to the plot, as they arguably are in 999. Plus, the game makes it fairly clear that it&#39;s set in Japan, so westernizing the names would have meant an additional expanding cloud of changes, and at that point you start to wonder if it&#39;s worth it.</p>
<p>For something like Ace Attorney, I agree with the localizers that the names, etc, need to be localized. The tone and humor of the game would be irreparably damaged by, say, a protagonist named Ryūichi Naruhodō. Japanese audiences get that joke, but to a western audience it means effectively nothing, and attempting to explain the joke is awkward, takes the player out of the experience, and, I mean, once you have to explain a joke, it&#39;s not really that funny is it?</p>
<p>The one thing I might shy away from doing is setting it in a specific, real place. If we&#39;re moving the game from Japan and changing all the names, setting it in &quot;Los Angeles&quot; seems a little weird. I&#39;d probably prefer to go with the tone of the game and set it in, say, the city of &quot;Las Diablos&quot; or something. It almost feels weirdly like...appropriation, I guess? But that&#39;s kind of a nit-pick.</p>
<p>In general, my feeling is that if the game, its plot, and its themes depend very heavily on their location (in this case, generally that means Japan) then names and the like should probably be left alone. To wit: Hakuoki, where all character names were left unchanged. (The stuff we DID change in Hakuoki is another subject, one which I&#39;ve covered before over on my <a href="http://keikakumeansplan.tumblr.com/post/29181576151/localization-choices-for-the-terms-rasetsu-and" title="Localization Choices for the Terms &quot;Rasetsu&quot; and &quot;Ochimizu&quot; from Hakuoki">localization blog</a>) If the location is less important, and the nuances of the names are more important (to wit: 999), then change away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do Japanese game devs/pubs you&#39;ve worked with want to check your localizations, or do they trust that you did a good job? Also, do they ask for specific things to be localized in a certain way? I&#39;m thinking about how NISA were told by Spike Chunsoft to not change Monokuma to Monobear in Danganronpa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally no, in my experience there hasn&#39;t been a lot of oversight from the Japanese publisher/developer when it comes to the localization, at least not on the projects I&#39;ve been involved with. (Although when it comes to the marketing...) There have been one or two instances where we were specifically asked to do or not do a particular thing, but often than had more to do with copyrights and trademarks than anything else.</p>
<p>I usually do, however, ask the developer when I want to make a significant change or I&#39;m unsure about an important detail (i.e., someone&#39;s name, clarify the function or nature of an item, etc) to sort of preempt this. They do essentially have final say over what goes out, and if they decided they DIDN&#39;T like something it could make my life very unpleasant. Generally, though, the developers I&#39;ve worked with have been pretty helpful—Chunsoft and Uchikoshi especially were extremely responsive, accommodating, and helpful during the production of both 999 and VLR.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the topic of G-OLM: are you conversant enough in Cockney to just be able to write like that, or did you have to do research? Did you consider using any other dialects/accents?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/loc_p_1/golm.png" class="pull-right img-rounded" title="G-OLM" alt="G-OLM from Aksys Games and Spike-Chunsoft's 'Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward'">
My knowledge of Cockney is pretty much limited to watching a few British movies, mainly Snatch. So, no, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself conversant. I did do a fair amount of research when I was writing that section, mostly on Cockney rhyming slang. (i.e. &quot;lords and peers&quot; -&gt; &quot;ears&quot;) I wanted to put in more of the rhyming slang (it&#39;s cool as heck), but </p>
<ul>
<li>It would have gotten obtuse and confusing FAST</li>
<li>I wasn&#39;t honestly sure I was good enough at it to make that convincing</li>
<li>It started to feel a little...exploitative, I guess</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual delivery was all the voice actor—we specifically chose someone who demonstrated that he had knowledge of Cockney on his demo reel. And he did an amazing job!
I settled on Cockney for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy accents in J media are often localized into some manner of accent from the southern United States, for a lot of different reasons, but the end result is that by this point that&#39;s kind of cliche and played out, so I didn&#39;t want to use a southern accent. True, the specific accent he had (Kawachi dialect) is something that would probably be considered sort of &quot;hick-ish&quot; in Japan, and I could have gone with that sort of American accent, but that seemed boring, and part of the point of G-OLM&#39;s accent is that it comes out of <em>nowhere</em>—its &quot;extremeness&quot; should surprise you (nearly everyone in the office who understands Japanese started to laugh awkwardly as soon as they heard him start to talk in Japanese). I figured Cockney would have a similar sort of effect on American audience. </li>
<li>An American audience would be less likely to notice/get pissed off if I screwed it up</li>
<li>I like Cockney</li>
</ul>
<p>I haven&#39;t heard any reports from people who are <em>actually</em> familiar with Cockney telling me I totally messed it up, but the English dub isn&#39;t available in Europe, so...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you&#39;re someone in the industry, what&#39;s your stance on bringing VNs with erotic content to the West? Not necessarily in the context of Aksys, but just in the big picture, like how they should be handled. Should the sex scenes be cut out? Left in? Offered separately?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, so, this is kind of a big, complicated question that touches on a lot of stuff, but first I’m going to sort of set some of the terms of what I’m going to say, so there’s no confusion.</p>
<p>I can only guess at what it means to you to say &quot;VNs with erotic content,&quot; but for the purposes of what I’m about to say, I’m going to assume that means anything where sexual intercourse is displayed in a graphic, explicit manner (and yes, it’s still graphic and explicit if there are mosaics). This includes, of course, penile-vaginal penetrative sex, but also includes oral, anal, and all sorts of other fascinating sexual maneuvers that I either can’t think of or am too embarrassed to describe.</p>
<p>I’d also like to make it clear that I understand there are different kinds of erotic VNs—those were the sex works ostensibly in service of a larger narrative, and those were the whole point is just to see a couple of people going at it. Unfortunately 99% of the time, this is going to be an academic distinction: If we see people having sex in an explicit way (roughly approximated: We see genitals being manipulated with the intent of causing sexual pleasure to one or more parties) then that puts it into a particular class of media that most people will just call “porn.” It is certainly possible, and possibly desirable, that eventually society will move beyond this particular view, but the chances of that happening in my lifetime are slim to none.</p>
<p><em>SO</em></p>
<p>First there are a couple things to consider business-wise:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you publish, create, or otherwise distribute erotic VNs, you will immediately find yourself in a very small niche that is very difficult to get out of.</li>
<li>You will get a reputation as a porn peddler.</li>
<li>The distribution avenues available to you are extremely limited.</li>
<li>Localizing any kind of visual novel is a lot of work for your translators and/or editors.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/loc_p_1/mosaic.png" class="pull-left img-rounded" title="Lewd" alt="A lewd mosaic">
What this boils down to is that the profit margins are going to be exceedingly slim. Only a very small subset of gamers will even considering buying what you’re selling, and it will be difficult to sell it regardless: You can’t publish on any console (AFAIK the NA branches of the big three will never let erotic content on their platforms), and larger DD services for PC (i.e., Steam) won’t let you on for the same reasons. Most retail outlets won’t stock your product either. The few services that will take you have much smaller distribution, and can enforce much worse terms for you if they want, since they’re the only game in town. Obviously it’s not an impossible business model to manage—JAST and Mangagamer have been publishing erotic VNs for a while now—but it’s risky, gives you a bad reputation, and has no clear payoff. Plus, if you decide it was a bad idea, you’re kind of stuck: Trying to throw off the reputation of porn peddler isn’t going to be easy. Additionally, if you want any kind of quality you’re going to have to spend a lot of time (read: money) getting something approaching &quot;good&quot; from your text.</p>
<p>In other words, I understand why most publishers won’t touch them with a ten-foot pole. If I ran a publishing house, I sure wouldn’t.</p>
<p>But I haven’t really addressed your questions directly, so let me do that: </p>
<p>Cutting out the sex scenes vs. leaving them in, given the current market, is a pretty simple answer, I think: Leave them in. If you are a small publisher, willing to publish erotic material, then you lose nothing by doing so. If you’re slightly larger, then whatever you might gain in additional market-share will be quickly offset by the uproar when fans discover that the sex has been cut. Even if potential customers don’t really care whether there’s sex in there or not, it will become clear to all that your game is a &quot;porn game,&quot; which will make it much more difficult to sell—regardless of whether or not there’s any porn in it. Visual novels of any sort are already a tough sell in the west, and having the heavy stigma of porn directly attached to one is not going to do you any favors.</p>
<p>As far as my personal feelings, I don’t particularly care for erotic VNs. I have a hard time imagining how a story is improved by explicit, titillating sex. I can see how porn can be improved by adding a good story, but that doesn’t seem to be how most people asking for erotic VNs frame the argument. In my opinion, localizing (or writing) erotic VNs has too many downsides (stigma, small market, confusing narrative goals) and a profit margin that’s far too slim. While I’m not necessarily opposed to sex, even explicit sex, in a narrative anywhere, I’d like to see it either serve a purpose, or at least demonstrate healthy sexual behavior—neither of which are things I’m convinced the vast majority of erotic VNs do. Obviously there’s plenty of room for argument there, and my knowledge is certainly very limited, but I’m not saying no one should do them, just that I don’t really have a personal interest in doing so.</p>
