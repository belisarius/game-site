I've been watching a butt-ton of Attack on Titan because it isÂ <em>the business</em> and on my way home from work today I was thinking about a bunch of ideas for an AoT game that I will never be able to make. But someone else might! Also I thought it was kind of cool. So here we go:
<ul>
	<li>Gameplay is based around commanding a small squad and killing titans with your squad.
<ul>
	<li>I need to check the anime, but I think a squad would be about 5-7 people.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Initially your squad is assigned to you at random: They're cadets just out of training who have elected to join the Garrison Regiment.
<ul>
	<li>There might be a small chance you'd get "unique" squad members, i.e. characters from the show. They might have unique abilities and/or especially good stats.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Combat plays out a bit like the 360/PS3-gen Spiderman games, although with more of a focus on horizontal swings as opposed to vertical ones, and with the speed increased somewhat.
<ul>
	<li>Controller triggers would control the two 3DMG cables: Pulling the trigger fires a cable directly ahead, keeping it depressed reels you toward wherever the cable hit, and releasing the trigger releases the cable.</li>
	<li>You can quickly target parts of titans, i.e. the fingers, the shoulders, the nape, the Achilles tendon, etc. Once a part is targeted, your cables will center on it when you aim, making it easy to pull yourself towards. You can adjust aiming away from the target, though (it just default snaps the aim to the target when you begin to aim).</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 24px;">You can switch between squad members at any time, with the push of a button. This allows you to execute complex combo maneuvers.</span></li>
	<li>People can (and will) die suddenly, as in the anime. If you are controlling a member of your squad when they die, you are immediately switched to whoever is the commander of your squad.
<ul>
	<li>If the commander dies, another squad member immediately becomes commander. Not sure how this would be decided, though.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li></li>
</ul>
Switch between squad members at any time

switch between squad members when one dies

different character roles, i.e. finisher, support, harrier, etc (based on character archetypes in the show, i.e. Levi would be a finisher, Mikasa finisher or harrier, Armin support, etc)

skill growth

doesn't necessarily follow plot of anime

recruit new squaddies when members die

die quickly, like in the show
